Aesthetic is a NextJS app, deployed to Vercel.

We use Node v18.17.0.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Environment variables

Create a local `.env.local` based on `.env.example`. Add a valid Serp API key to get started.

## Production

The production version of the app can be viewed at [aesthetic-prod.vercel.app](https://aesthetic-prod.vercel.app/).
